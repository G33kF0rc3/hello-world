# Hello World!

Good, you are finally here. This is your personal, **Hello World** repository. Inside of it, you are going to create two different Hello World Projects, one in HTML and one in Javascript.

### Prerequisites

Of course, you can't just start coding. You need some tools. And that is the reason why this README file exists.

##### 1. Get yourself a text editor
As you might already know, you can't just write code in Word or Pages. Code needs to be written in something called "Plain Text". Plain text is text without any formatting, just text.

I recommend you to use [Atom](https://atom.io/) as your text editor, it's free.

##### 2. Javascript Node
To run Javascript outside of your browser, we need something called "Node". Node is a JavaScript runtime, we'll teach you more about it later.

##### 3. Git
This whole project is managed with Git. Git is a version control system, it allows people to collaborate and it also allows to track who did what. Simple.

I recommend you to use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) for this, as it has a painless integration with GitHub.

### Cloning the repo



### HTML Hello World

First, we got to open your project folder inside of atom. Once you opened atom, press ⌘+⇧+O to open a new project and navigate to where you cloned your project to. You can close all tabs that open. In the sidebar, you should be able to see four things. One .git folder, one html folder, one js folder and one Readme.md file. We are going to edit the only file in the html folder. Open it up!

You should see something like
```html
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Hello World!</title>
    </head>
    <body
        <!-- insert your hello world after this line -->


    </body>
</html>
```

This is the basic structure of an HTML file. HTML tag, which encapsules head and body. Now, right below the comment, add "Hello World" into the file. Then save (⌘+S) and navigate to the file in Finder. Double click it.


Congratulations! You have just made your first Hello World!
